# Config Events

The Config Events extension allows you to fire change events on Config Sources.

## Usage

To use the Config Events, add the following to your Maven `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.smallrye.config</groupId>
    <artifactId>smallrye-config-events</artifactId>
    <version>{{attributes['version']}}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Events

The CDI Event is a `ChangeEvent` and contains the following fields:

- String key
- Optional\<String> oldValue
- String newValue
- Type type
- String fromSource

The `ChangeEvent` can be of any of the following types:

- NEW - When you create a new key and value (i.e. the key does not exist anywhere in any config source)
- UPDATE - When you update a value of an existing key (i.e. the key and value exist somewhere in a config source)
- REMOVE - When you remove the value from the source (and that changed the overall config)

### Observing Events

You can listen to all or some of these events, filtering by `type` and/or `key` and/or `source`, example:

```java
// Getting all config event
public void all(@Observes ChangeEvent changeEvent){
    log.log(Level.SEVERE, "ALL: Received a config change event: {0}", changeEvent);
}

// Get only new values
public void newValue(@Observes @TypeFilter(Type.NEW) ChangeEvent changeEvent){
    log.log(Level.SEVERE, "NEW: Received a config change event: {0}", changeEvent);
}

// Get only override values
public void overrideValue(@Observes @TypeFilter(Type.UPDATE) ChangeEvent changeEvent){
    log.log(Level.SEVERE, "UPDATE: Received a config change event: {0}", changeEvent);
}

// Get only revert values
public void revertValue(@Observes @TypeFilter(Type.REMOVE) ChangeEvent changeEvent){
    log.log(Level.SEVERE, "REMOVE: Received a config change event: {0}", changeEvent);
}

// Getting all config event when key is some.key
public void allForKey(@Observes @KeyFilter("some.key") ChangeEvent changeEvent){
    log.log(Level.SEVERE, "ALL for key [some.key]: Received a config change event: {0}", changeEvent);
}

// Getting all config event when key is some.key for new events
public void newForKey(@Observes @TypeFilter(Type.NEW) @KeyFilter("some.key") ChangeEvent changeEvent){
    log.log(Level.SEVERE, "NEW for key [some.key]: Received a config change event: {0}", changeEvent);
}

// Getting all config event when key is some.key for override events
public void overrideForKey(@Observes @TypeFilter(Type.UPDATE) @KeyFilter("some.key") ChangeEvent changeEvent){
    log.log(Level.SEVERE, "UPDATE for key [some.key]: Received a config change event: {0}", changeEvent);
}

// Getting all config event when key is some.key for revert events
public void revertForKey(@Observes @TypeFilter(Type.REMOVE) @KeyFilter("some.key") ChangeEvent changeEvent){
    log.log(Level.SEVERE, "REMOVE for key [some.key]: Received a config change event: {0}", changeEvent);
}

// Getting all config events for a certain source
public void allForSource(@Observes @SourceFilter("MemoryConfigSource") ChangeEvent changeEvent){
    log.log(Level.SEVERE, "ALL for source [MemoryConfigSource]: Received a config change event: {0}", changeEvent);
}

// Getting all config events for a certain source
public void allForSourceAndKey(@Observes @SourceFilter("MemoryConfigSource") @KeyFilter("some.key")  ChangeEvent changeEvent){
    log.log(Level.SEVERE, "ALL for source [MemoryConfigSource] and for key [some.key]: Received a config change event: {0}", changeEvent);
}

// Getting all config events for a certain source
public void overrideForSourceAndKey(@Observes @TypeFilter(Type.UPDATE) @SourceFilter("MemoryConfigSource") @KeyFilter("some.key")  ChangeEvent changeEvent){
    log.log(Level.SEVERE, "UPDATE for source [MemoryConfigSource] and for key [some.key]: Received a config change event: {0}", changeEvent);
}
```

Note: You can filter by including the `@TypeFilter` and/or the `@KeyFilter` and/or the `@SourceFilter`.

### Pattern matching on field.

You might want to listen for fields that match a certain regex.

Example, listen to all keys that starts with `some.`:

```java
@RegexFilter("^some\\..+")
public void allForPatternMatchOnKey(@Observes ChangeEvent changeEvent){
    log.log(Level.SEVERE, "Pattern match on key: Received a config change event: {0}", changeEvent);
}
```

By default, it will match on `key`, however you also listen on another field, for example, listen to all `oldValue` 
that starts with `some.`:

```java
@RegexFilter(onField = Field.oldValue, value = "^some\\..+")
public void allForPatternMatchOnOldValue(@Observes ChangeEvent changeEvent){
    log.log(Level.SEVERE, "Pattern match on old value: Received a config change event: {0}", changeEvent);
}
```

You can Match on the following fields of the `ChangeEvent` object:

- key
- oldValue
- newValue
- fromSource

## Implementing Events in a ConfigSource

The `ChangeEventNotifier` allows you to detect changes and fire the appropriate events.

To use it in your own source:

- Get a snapshot of the properties before the change.
- Get a snapshot of the properties after the change.
- Call `detectChangesAndFire` method:

Example:

```java
Map<String,String> before = new HashMap<>(configSource.getProperties());
memoryConfigSource.getProperties().remove(key);
Map<String,String> after = new HashMap<>(configSource.getProperties());
ChangeEventNotifier.getInstance().detectChangesAndFire(before, after,configSource.getName());
```

or if you know the change and do not need detection:

```java
configSource.getProperties().remove(key);
ChangeEventNotifier.getInstance().fire(new ChangeEvent(Type.REMOVE,key,getOptionalOldValue(oldValue),null,configSource.getName()));
```
