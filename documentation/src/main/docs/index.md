# SmallRye Config

**SmallRye Config** is a library that provides a way to configure applications, frameworks and containers. It is used 
in applications servers like [WildFly](https://wildfly.org/) and [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io), or frameworks 
like [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io). It can also be used completely standalone in any Java application, which makes it a 
very flexible library. 

It follows the [MicroProfile Config](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/) specification to provide 
the initial config foundations and expands with it own concepts to cover a wide range of use cases observed in the 
configuration space.
