== ZooKeeper Config Source

Config Source implementation to support Apache Zookeeper.

The benefits are that configurations can be shared across applications and a future version will allow applications to
subscribe to updates to the configuration parameters.

=== Usage

To use the Zookeeper Config Source, add the following to your Maven `pom.xml`:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.smallrye.config</groupId>
    <artifactId>smallrye-config-source-zookeeper</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

This Config Source will automatically register with your application.

You also need to bootstrap your application with the location of your Zookeeper server and a unique identifier for your
application. Add the following to `src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` or create equivalent
Environment Variables.

[source,properties]
----
io.smallrye.configsource.zookeeper.url=localhost:2181
io.smallrye.configsource.zookeeper.applicationId=com.example.my-application
----

Any properties that are looked up via the Config API or Injected will be looked up in Zookeeper in addition to the
default MicroProfile Config locations.

The ConfigSource will store the following znodes in the specified Zookeeper server
`/applicationId/propertyName = value`.

This Config Source has a lower priority than the default Sources and thus *will not* override property files or
Environment Variables.
